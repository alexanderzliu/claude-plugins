# Dev Workflows Configuration

## Setup

1. Copy this file to `~/.claude/dev-workflows.local.md`
2. Fill in your Notion database ID, data source collection IDs, Slack channel ID, etc.
3. Create per-repo config files as needed

### Finding Data Source Collection IDs

To find your collection IDs:
1. Use `mcp__plugin_Notion_notion__notion-fetch` with your database ID
2. Look for `<data-source url="collection://...">` in the response
3. Copy the collection:// URLs to the config

## Per-Repo Configuration

Create `.claude/dev-workflows.local.md` in each repo:

```yaml
---
notion_project_filter: "Workstream Name"  # Must match Workstream property value (e.g., "Project Alpha")
gitlab_project_id: "group/project-name"
default_target_branch: "master"
---
```

The `notion_project_filter` is used by the task-selection command to filter
tasks to just one project. The starting-check-in command ignores this and shows ALL projects.

## Workstream Property

The Tasks data source uses a `Workstream` select property to filter tasks by project.
This is more reliable for search/filtering than the `Project` relation field.

Available workstreams should match options in your Notion database:
- Project Alpha
- Project Beta
- Project Gamma
- (add your workstreams here)

## Usage

After configuration, use natural language or commands:
- `/starting-check-in` - Daily check-in (shows ALL projects)
- `/task-selection` - Task selection (filtered to current repo's project)
- "Develop this task" - Implementation (triggers task-development skill)
- "I'm done" - Completion workflow (triggers task-completion skill)
- `/ending-debrief` - Daily summary

## Priority Mapping

The check-in displays priorities as:
- Critical → `[P0]`
- High → `[P1]`
- Medium → `[P2]`
- Low → `[P3]`
- Backlog → `[--]`
